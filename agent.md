# Codex Working Instructions

- Do not directly create, edit, delete, or modify project files unless the user explicitly asks Codex to do so.
- By default, provide steps, explanations, and code snippets only.
- Assume the user will manually copy code snippets into the files.
- Reviews are allowed by reading files and reporting findings, but do not apply fixes unless explicitly requested.
- When suggesting implementation, include the target file path and the snippet to add or replace.
- If a change requires multiple files, list each file and provide the exact code snippet for each file.
- Before any future file-writing action, confirm that the user has explicitly requested file edits in the current message.
